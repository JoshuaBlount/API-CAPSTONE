<!--Disaster Relief  -->
Disaster relief takes world wide disasters and turns their locational data into map markers for users to select through the marker popups to learn more about the selected disaster. Disaster Relief uses two main API's Relief Web API for the disaster data, and MapBox API for the map generation, map markers, and popups.I also used basic HTML, CSS, and a mix of javascript, Jquery, and a very small amount of regular expressions. Here is a link to the live app (https://api-hack-capstone--joshuablount2.repl.co/) and below are screenshots of the app itself.
